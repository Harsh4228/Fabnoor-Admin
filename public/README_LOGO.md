Place the image you attached (logo.png) into this folder so the admin panel serves it as /logo.png.

Steps:
1. Save the attached image as `logo.png`.
2. Put the file at `public/logo.png` (this file: Fabnoor-Admin/public/logo.png).
3. Restart the dev server if it's running.

If /logo.png is not present, the admin panel will fall back to the bundled asset used during build.
